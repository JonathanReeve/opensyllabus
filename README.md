============

*The Open Syllabus Project* seeks to promote institutional cooperation in the task of gathering and analyzing a significant corpus of syllabi. Our principles are as follows:

*We believe in openness and transparency while respecting the intellectual property rights of all constituents.* We create and make publicly available a rich dataset of metadata, while protecting the original documents in a secure “research sandbox” environment.

*We believe in data-driven innovation.* A critical mass of documents can foster new tools, drive policy change, enable best-practices, provide metrics, and aid in search, discovery, and the creation of new course materials.

*We invite participating scholars and institutions to collaborate and benefit* from the project’s research, platform- and tool-development experiments. Our team includes the nation’s leading librarians and legal scholars who are committed to an ongoing dialog about knowledge sharing, preservation, and accessibility.
